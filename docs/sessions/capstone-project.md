# 🏆 Capstone Project: The "Agentic" Hackathon

**Goal:** Synthesize learning by building a feature using Agentic workflows.

## Project Overview

The capstone project brings together all concepts from the three sessions into a comprehensive hands-on experience. You'll build a complete feature using agentic workflows, demonstrating mastery of the tools and techniques covered.

## Project Requirements

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Session 1 Skills)
- **Agentic Workspace Setup**: Configure Cursor/Windsurf with optimal rules and agents
- **Flow State Achievement**: Establish productive AI-human collaboration patterns
- **Project Architecture**: Design atomic, SOLID structure using AI assistance

### Phase 2: Connected Development (Session 2 Skills)
- **MCP Integration**: Connect multiple tools (Figma, GitHub, Chrome DevTools)
- **Tool Chaining**: Create seamless workflow between design, development, and deployment
- **Vibe Coding**: Maintain context and flow across the entire development process

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Session 3 Skills)
- **TDD Implementation**: Write tests first with AI assistance
- **AI-Controlled Refactoring**: Improve code quality while maintaining functionality
- **High-Assurance Practices**: Ensure robust, maintainable code

## Deliverables

1. **Complete Feature Implementation**
   - Working code with full functionality
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Documentation and README

2. **Agentic Workflow Documentation**
   - Screenshots of AI tool configurations
   - MCP setup and integration examples
   - Prompt engineering examples used

3. **Reflection & Learning**
   - Challenges faced and solutions found
   - AI-human collaboration insights
   - Recommendations for future agentic development

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Excellence** (40%): Code quality, architecture, and testing
- **Agentic Workflow Mastery** (30%): Effective use of AI tools and MCP integrations
- **Innovation & Creativity** (20%): Unique approaches and solutions
- **Documentation & Communication** (10%): Clear explanation of process and outcomes

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Planning, setup, and architecture design
- **Week 2**: Core development with MCP integrations
- **Week 3**: Testing, refactoring, and documentation
- **Week 4**: Final polish, presentation preparation

## Success Metrics
